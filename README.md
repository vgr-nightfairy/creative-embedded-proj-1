# Creative Embedded Systems Project 1, Task 2
This project contains a Processing sketch that generates visuals meant for the Becton Cafe installation and runs on boot
from a Raspberry Pi utilizing the Pi's autostart feature. 
The concept of this sketch is centered around extra-terrestrials and UFOs and entertains the idea of 
their interaction with Earth, and the method is meant to emulate the artistic style of pointillism. The image that eventually
apparates on the wall is a sunset shot of Sterling Library that I took my sophomore year at Yale, and the image on the ceiling
is that of a UFO flying through a sunset-like sky.
This sketch is reproducible in the sense that it utilizes a very template-able method to generate its designs, as 
the code essentially works with the existing pixels of the image and manipulates them. It utilizes the installation space 
in a very intentional way, as the disruptive small squares are meant to lead/ slightly signal to the observer that some unusual scene
is awaiting them in the cafe. Finally, this visual is to be used to let the observer's imagination run wild, because 
by placing something as extreme as extra-terrestrials in the immediate context of Yale I expect it will 
be more intriguing and fun for the observerto entertain the idea of aliens on Earth.
